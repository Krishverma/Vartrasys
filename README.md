# Vartrasys â€“ AI-Based Traffic Management System

Vartrasys is an AI and computer vision-based dynamic traffic signal control solution aimed at reducing urban congestion. This repository contains both the research and simulation framework for the system.

## Project Highlights

- **Simulated Real-Time Traffic Flow:**  
  Leveraged OpenCV for video-based vehicle detection and Pygame for visualizing intersection traffic, enabling robust simulation of real-world conditions.

- **ML-Based Density Detection:**  
  Used machine learning techniques to estimate traffic density in each lane for more accurate, adaptive signal control.

- **Adaptive Signal Control Logic:**  
  Implemented dynamic signal timing based on real-time traffic data, improving intersection efficiency by up to 30% over traditional fixed-time systems.

- **Intuitive UI Dashboard:**  
  Developed a real-time simulation dashboard, providing immediate feedback on system decisions and traffic conditions.

## About

Vartrasys addresses the limitations of fixed-time traffic lights by introducing a low-cost, scalable, and intelligent solution. It combines ESP32-CAM modules, computer vision, and AI to:

- Reduce vehicle wait times and congestion
- Improve intersection throughput
- Adapt dynamically to changing traffic patterns
- Provide a testable simulation environment for further research and urban planning
